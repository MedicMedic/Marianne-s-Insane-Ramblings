Yup, I'm struggling. LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOO.

I might change all the dates to yy-mm-dd so it's sorted chronologically.

That's what smart people do, right?

I don't know by how much I need to get better at understanding the formal definition and way of finding derivatives.

But I need to get a move on if I wanna finish this by this month.

I'll just review the statistics course concurrently with the actual studying bit.

I hope I get a different professor, maybe?

I'd like to give Sir Hagos a try, if he teaches Advanced Statistics.

Because I don't want to confront Ma'am Quintana T-T.
