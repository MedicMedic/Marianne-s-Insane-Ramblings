So where were we?

Right, last Wednesday. The day of the exam.

Didn't sleep well, had to make a reviewer.

Asked for his reviewer, but apparently it was on his phone.

He didn't wash his uniform so he was late, while I had breakfast at school.

I sat with Ate Sam while I finished my reviewer.

Then I sat next to her during the exam.

We saved a seat for Vem.

Then, we did our exam.

Vem gave me his cool quiz maker thing (which I should also do, to be honest).

Then we started the exam.

Somehow, Vem and I got the same score of 34/40.

Sheesh.

He accused me of copying, so I just stuck my tongue out at him.

Then the guy had the audacity in Lab to get 27/30 in 12 minutes just because he wanted to pee?!

The absolute audacity.

I sadly only got 22/30. Wanted to be just as quick as he is, so I didn't overthink the whole quiz.

Sometimes overthinking is good.

He then left for SFM, which made me panic a bit since I wanted to say goodbye.

If I didn't get to talk to him solo, I would have just blocked without saying a word.

Which would suck. He did nothing wrong. He's my dear friend.

Noriel actually invited me and Ate Sam to go to this place in Visayas Ave or something.

And I was going to go.

But then I remembered that Vem wouldn't be able to join us if I were there so I had to stay back, and I got Ate Sam to go with me.

Ate Sam treated me lunch and I treated her water.

Then I asked if Vem is gonna join us, and he said yes.

Greatest relief of my life.

So we were just chilling and then we all had to part ways.

I got Vem alone when Ate Sam had to take the tricycle.

So I started my speech.

I told him that I misinterpreted our friendship and that I've been going crazy because of it, so I need to block him everywhere for at least a month during the sem break.

It took him a bit to process it, but he asked if he did anything wrong. I said he didn't, it's just me.

So basically I confessed that I had feelings for him but that I am gonna work on stopping having those feelings.

He asked if we could still be groupmates, and I said sure. 

It was a very awkward walk home.

He confided in me about his horrible love life, too. I didn't get to. I think his head will explode if I did.

He said all he did was him wanting to be an "ideal" with the ladies, so maybe girls won't copy his ex (I think?) and...do horrible stuff.

Then he said "nabiktima pala kita."

I hate being a victim, but I didn't correct him.

We ended our conversation in front of the dorms. He said, "I hope we could still be friends."

I sure hope so. But with how deep my feelings apparently are, and since it isn't a fight, it might take a while.

I left him my cactus bookmark, which says, in Kanji.

# 私のカメの友達
# 有り難う御座います
# 頑張って
# 左様なら
# 御免なさい

I need to fix my brain. Reframe the love I have into something platonic.

Because that's all I'll get.

That's all I want to get.

I love Vem.

And hopefully I could change that (romantic) love into a friendly love.
