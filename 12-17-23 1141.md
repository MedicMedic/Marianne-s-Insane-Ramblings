Khan Academy is a difficult site.

My ADHD won't let me finish everything without getting all the things have a completion mark.

Is that ADHD or OCD?

I can't tell. All I know is this brain of mine ain't typical.

First we learn about limits.

Limits are easy, but also relatively basic.

Sadly, I also forgot a lot of things.
