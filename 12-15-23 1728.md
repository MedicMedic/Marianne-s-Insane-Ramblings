Damn, I haven't updates this in a really long time.

Shame, 'cause I would have really needed it.

So what happened since November 29?

A lot.

Primarily confirmed some of my paranoia.

But what's worse is that I have been relegated to a best friend role.

It sucks, even though it shouldn't, probably.

So let's pick up where we left off: blocking Vem.

I unblocked him for a bit to check if he was online, and then I got a message asking about our group project.

I broke at that point and started apologizing profusely.

Turns out he has been looking for me. 

Felt really guilty.
