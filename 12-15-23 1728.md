Damn, I haven't updates this in a really long time.

Shame, 'cause I would have really needed it.

So what happened since November 29?

A lot.

Primarily confirmed some of my paranoia.

But what's worse is that I have been relegated to a best friend role.

It sucks, even though it shouldn't, probably.

So let's pick up where we left off: blocking Vem.

I unblocked him for a bit to check if he was online, and then I got a message asking about our group project.

I broke at that point and started apologizing profusely.

Turns out he has been looking for me. 

Felt really guilty.

Admitted that I was acting like an ass, which is true.

I then explained—in very vague, non-commital phrasing—that he had triggered my obsessive personality and I wanted to step away before it consumed me.

Though I don't think he understood it that way.

At least, maybe now he does.

We'll get there later.

So things went well after that. Chatting daily, making jokes, being funny.

I got my obsession dialed down, but I still had feelings.

Did you know that I started planning for my future with the vision that I could end up being a minister's wife?

I wanted to get my master's in computer science so I would have a job if I ended up with him.

Which I actually wanted to do if he asked.

BUT only after he had already graduated from SFM.

Because they said stopping yourself from being an MWife just because of being vain, despite having feelings for the guy, is a sure way to get cursed.

And I have truly flirted once.

It wasn't a line full of rizz.

I don't find Vem physically attractive at all, I like him for his personality.

So I just said he's cute.

Even though the real rizz is if I had said "handsome."

I don't have the guts to truly say that, I'm not *that* in love, sheesh.

But he has called me pretty/cute 3 times so far.

What psycho does that? I'm a sucker for compliments.

Then I wrote our script for TOPL, but he didn't seem enthusiastic about it.

Which then triggered my avoidant/anxious attachment so I steamrolled the whole thing, made the script, recorded the video, and recorded one for my solo project.

*There were ups and downs, but all I did was fall.*

Sheesh, I'm so cringe.

I'm reading through old messages so I can write this.

At one point, I asked him to never leave me.

He said "I'm here, but..."

Takes a whole different meaning now.

You'll see later.

May I just include this picture?

I just love it so much.

OH, YEAH AND THIS BEACH AT SOME POINT SAID "I hope it's not 'boy' because if it is, we'd both be in a lot of trouble."

Which I took to mean, "hey, I'm thinking about it, but not yet."

BUT APPARENTLY...agh.

I'll explain later.

Then I scared him that morning that I drank efficascent oil.

To be fair, I might as well have. I consumed a lot.

He then declared me my study rival.

Would have preferred school wife, but guess not. 

Vem, I'm so sorry if you see this.

I then scared him that the Japanese Final Assessment is scary and terrifying which made him nervous.

Said I had to even the field.

Which is an explanation for what I did.

Shut up, I'll say it soon. Here we go.

And then on Friday, he asked me for the Library Day answers (see image above).

And because I love him (gag), I sacrificed some data to send 40 pics of book screenshots.

I was stressed from our Year End party which I planned solo and was on the way back home.

But I still gave them.

Then later that night, he asked me a question:

"Hey uhm, do you think there's a chance for a person, 6 years older than me, to have interest in me?"

My initial response: "Wtf" was said out loud and unabbreviated.

My heart crumbled, dude. My chest felt tight and I felt tears coming up my eyes.

But all I said was "yeah duh AHAHHAHAHAH"

I even encouraged him to talk about her with me, even though all I wanted was to murder this woman I don't even know the name and face of.

Later that night, I restricted his accounts and cried in the bathroom, naked and miserable.

On my bed, I wrote a message to my ex, Michael, blaming him for so much, especially since every interaction with Vem reminds me of him so much.

And maybe that's why I've been so afraid and pushed the person away, which made him set his eyes on another person.

I don't really know. Maybe I just wanted to be angry.

But Michael read the whole spam of text and actually responded. Which I didn't expect.

And somehow, I got closure with Michael.

Relieving, to be honest.

But the dumbass thing is that I showed it to Vem.

Well, not the whole thing. Just the second part of the first message.

He didn't really understand. He asked about Michael but he didn't seem interested in knowing too much lore.

That's when I decided I was leaving after the semester.

I've actually been planning that since November. Hell, I think I may have mentioned it in this repository.

But projects kept me from dropping him.

I don't know what to do.

There's still more lore.

We have a new inside joke: "turn your frown upside down."

Because I really would like to snap his neck.

I told him that's what I'll do if he is sad.

He said "don't come near me."

Should've said that at the beginning of October, stupid.

He added that I should solve my own sadness like that.

Maybe I should, Vem.

Then I showed him screenshots of the TOPL project I made if I wanted to separate from him.

Thank goodness I did that. He's so slow.

Then he said he needs to stop thinking about Vem.

And I said "yeah, I should do that too. I mean what what what what."

I really should.

Please help.

Still, he was thinking of someone else. And I ignored my crumbling heart as it would be the last time this year, or maybe even forever.

He then posted some long rant about the heart, which my roommates saw. Sucks, sad, ugh.

Sucks knowing I'm not a single thought in that.

I want the last bit of our friendship to be in a separate file, so bye.
