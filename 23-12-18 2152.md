I powered through Unit 1 of AP/College Calculus AB, which is all about limits.

I already finished that before, just had to redo things.

Made a lot of mistakes.

Vem got 1.50 in Advanced Stats, I target to beat it.

I am aiming for higher, duh.

There are three courses, though I likely could just visit the College Statistics course right now.

Based on the assignments Vem gave me (none of which I did), that's probably wise.

Wish me luck.
