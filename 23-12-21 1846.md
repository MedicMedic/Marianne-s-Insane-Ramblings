I have erased all the personal inputs so this is purely a repository for knowledge.

Or at least my lack thereof.

I had a brilliant idea during WS, the best place to get brilliant ideas.

Audio files don't really translate well in GitHub. It should be text, right?

That's why this isn't a music collaboration app yet.

But what if I create a programming language that turns DAWs into writable code.

Like each note is an equivalent of a string like C4 or D#5?

Then the instruments are importable package.

I'd call it the StellarSong.

Of course.

I grew my brand as an anonymous figure, sacrificing my brand as Marianne.

I don't even know how to design Marianne.

Literally, I'd be putting a wacky banner on my GitHub page to make fun of my classmates who put fancy stuff on theirs.

Wish me luck.
