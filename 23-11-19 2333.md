I don't know how to code anything.

All I can actually make is "Hello, World!"

I ripped all my code from ChatGPT.

Yes, even the ones from 2021 (I'm a time traveler).

I want to throw up.

My anxiety is back and also I shouldn't be feeling this wayâ€”I'm in Glee.

I wanna kill myself but not at the same time.

Wouldn't it be funny if all these emotions were all caused by me having my period?

And so my entire being, personality, and self are all exclusively made by my hormones.

I told you this is gonna be insane rambling.

I planned to talk about how I'm gonna fix my code, but instead, I'm trauma dumping.

I spellcheck my insane ramblings too.

I smell bad; I should _hilamos_.
