I wrote so much then accidentally closed the tab and I didn't save anything.

Why does Github not have autosave?

ANYWAY, I DISCOVERED SOMETHING HUGE.

My old HTML projects!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm going to upload them and make myself proud.

I wish I can regain my 2nd Year projects, but I can definitely find a few, I hope.
