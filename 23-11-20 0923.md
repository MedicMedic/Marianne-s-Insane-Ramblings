I'm trying to keep busy to prevent my anxiety from turning into depression.

The advantage is that I have now uploaded all the things in my workspace here, so now my future employers will drool at how robust my Githun is compared to my puny classmates.

The disadvantage is that I now have nothing to do but make the thing with Vem.

Maybe he triggered my anxiety so that I have to start working.

Will I get an endearing drawing of myself after this?

Still salty about that. What's the point of hanging out with a beanie boi if he isn't gonna sketch you?

Vem, I'm sorry in advance if you ever read this. You chose the wrong person to warm up to and now she's hyperfixated on you.

AND EVERYONE I HYPERFIXATE ON GETS TRAUMATIZED.

I need to take care of myself now before I stress about the group project.

I should have left the house 28 minutes ago.

I should be on the way back to the dorms.

But, hey, at least I've uploaded everything.

And I'm getting sent to Student Counselling because I exhibit signs of distress.

Go ahead, guys. I've been wanting free therapy since the beginning of this year.
