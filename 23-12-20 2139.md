Did Sir Hagos ever teach the formal definition of derivatives?

That...was his job, wasn't it?

I failed myself.

Perhaps it's both.

Maybe it was taught but I didn't attend class.

I wish I did better.

I saw Vem's TOR, I feel depressed.

Now, all that's teaching me is Sal Khan because I refuse to be taught by my mother.

I don't even know why.

Anyway, in case I forget.

x = c. I always forget that.

I do concede that I failed myself.

Blaming the existence of others is futile because I chose to let them exist in my head.

I need therapy.
