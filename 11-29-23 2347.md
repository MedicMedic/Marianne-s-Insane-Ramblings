Someone please stop me before I change my mind and unblock him.

I don't wannaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

But also, I miss having someone to talk to. I have so much to say.

But like I feel horrible for wanting to say it. It's like I'm bothering him.

Will I ever meet someone I feel can just message whenever and it isn't weird because I get messaged whenever too?

I hope so.

But also I don't care. I already have one and it's my best friend.

Why bother with men when you have an awesome best friend who is basically your girlfriend anyway?
