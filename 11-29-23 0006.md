Sometimes, I don't know why I even bothered trying.

What did I expect anyway? Everlasting love or something?

He's ugly anyway.

I don't want to work on the project anymore.

Perhaps I should finish it by myself.

Because I don't know why, but my project partner is cold and distant.

Am I too much?

Is that something I should fix?

Is that something I _want_ to fix?

Why am I even stressing about this?

This crap is what got me that 5.0.

I

Gender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I should focus on myself, work by myself, and do things by myself.

Working with Marasigan has done nothing but slow down my process.

I only did them because I really really like him.

He motivated me.

I might have fallen.

But I shouldn't like him because he's gonna make me waste 4 years of surgeries and brain damage because of his life choices.

I should stop.

If I let myself get attached further, it's going to be harder to let go.

He can have my JavaScript code.

All those were borne out of love and not necessity anyway.

Sorry, Vem.
