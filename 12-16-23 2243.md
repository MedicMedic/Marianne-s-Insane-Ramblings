So apparently everything on here is about Vem and my obsession?

Cringe. This was supposed to be for studying.

Story of my life.

Next sem, I have to retake my Advanced Statistics.

I learned nothing from that subject, so I'm still technically starting from scratch.

It's weird that I got so bad at math, it used to be my favorite subject.

I got a Distinction award in the Australian Maths Competition.

Literally my only achievement in my life.

What the hell happened to me?

I actually started this way before, but my dumb self cleared cookies, so I lost all progress.

And I didn't sign up.

I will this time.

Does Khan Academy have certificates?
