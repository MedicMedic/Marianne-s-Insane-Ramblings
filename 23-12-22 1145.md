Sharing your feelings is like exposing your clothes.

There's variations to it, like some of them are for everyone to see.

Some of them you flaunt.

And some of them are underwear.

You only show them to people you really really like and/or comfortable with.

What the hyuck was I thinking displaying those here?

I mean, I deleted them, but apparently, I didn't delete them enough.

Fork me.

No, don't fork this.

I'm thinking of a visual novel plot.

I'm gonna use Ren'Py because everyone uses Ren'Py and my favorite games were made on Ren'Py.

I'm decent with Python, I can make wacky stuff like Monika does.

I'll make him love me, whether he likes it or not.

You know, maybe this is why no one loves me long enough to matter.
